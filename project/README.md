**Overview**
* Look over the datasets from https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset
* Examining Philly’s Black Bottom
- Covariates
  - Environment --> [heat vulnerability] () —> 
  - Hospital access -->  [access to certain types of healthcare](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/philadelphia-hospitals/) 
  - Transportation --> may be able to use [walk score](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/walk-score-phila-only/)
  - Food --> access to food (categorical) 
  - health stats --> https://philadelphiapublichealth.shinyapps.io/philastats/ 
  - affordable housing ratio 
- Can we build a model that examines gentrification/inequality/access
  - adopt global “GENIE” score
  - calculate GINI coefficient for a few neighborhoods from census data 

- basic measurement units: census blocks, what do these datasets use? 

- models to use 
1. lm 
2. glm + LASSO 
3. NN 

- evaluate these models 
- start with just Philly data, then share that we can maybe extend to other cities

- discussion group for Open Data Philly https://groups.google.com/g/opendataphilly?pli=1
